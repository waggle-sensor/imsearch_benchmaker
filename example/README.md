# Example

This folder contains an example of how to use the imsearch_benchmaker framework with its inputs and outputs.

>NOTE: The files do not contain all the data, they are just examples. If the full pipeline was ran with the provided config.toml file, you will get the full input and output files in the respective directories and the Hugging Face dataset will be created in the hf_dataset directory. Also this example is based on the FireBench benchmark, but the config.toml file is not the actual FireBench config.toml file see the [FireBench repository](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/imsearch_benchmarks/tree/main/FireBenchMaker) for the actual config.toml file.
